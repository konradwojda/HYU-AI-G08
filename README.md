## Project Title: 
**Deep Fake Image Detector**

## Proposal:
In recent years, with the rapid growth of AI and the ease of generating fake images, “deep fakes” have emerged as a significant threat, impacting not only celebrities but also everyday individuals. This issue has gained particular attention in Korea, where deep fakes have reached alarming levels, with an unprecedented number of images being generated in recent months. This growing concern inspired us to focus on developing a solution to detect deep fakes effectively.  

Our objective is to build an accurate deep fake image detector by training and comparing the performance of various models. To accomplish this, we plan to utilize a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images), which contains approximately 190,000 facial images. We will split the dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for validation. The models we intend to use include EfficientNet and ResNet50, among others. Once trained, the models will be analyzed thoroughly to evaluate their effectiveness. Depending on the results, we may further extend the scope of our project.  

For training, we plan to use our local hardware. However, if additional resources are required, we will leverage AWS SageMaker within the limits of available free credits.
